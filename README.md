# 🎮 Low-Level Arcade

A comprehensive monorepo of **essential programming concepts** that most tutorials skip or gloss over. This collection focuses on the fundamental, low-level details that separate beginners from confident developers.

## 🎯 Mission

Most programming tutorials teach you syntax and basic concepts, but they often miss the **crucial details** that help you truly understand what's happening under the hood. This repository fills those gaps by providing hands-on, interactive examples of concepts like:

- **Memory management** and pointer arithmetic
- **Type coercion** and implicit conversions  
- **Scope chains** and closure mechanics
- **Event loops** and asynchronous behavior
- **Prototype chains** and inheritance models
- **Memory layouts** and data structure internals

## 🧠 Philosophy

**"Learn the fundamentals they forgot to teach you"**

This isn't about advanced algorithms or complex frameworks. It's about understanding the **foundational concepts** that make you write better code, debug more effectively, and reason about performance and behavior with confidence.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### C++
- **Pointer Arithmetic**: Memory addresses, array traversal, pointer math
- **Memory Management**: Stack vs heap, RAII, smart pointers
- **Type System**: Implicit conversions, casting, type safety
- **Object Lifecycle**: Constructors, destructors, copy semantics

### Vanilla JavaScript
- **Type Coercion**: Truthy/falsy, implicit conversions, comparison quirks
- **Scope & Closures**: Lexical scope, closure mechanics, variable hoisting
- **Event Loop**: Call stack, task queue, microtasks, async behavior
- **Prototypes**: Prototype chain, inheritance, method resolution

### Vanilla TypeScript
- **Type System**: Structural typing, type inference, generic constraints
- **Compilation**: Type erasure, transpilation, type checking
- **Advanced Types**: Conditional types, mapped types, template literals
- **Module System**: Import/export mechanics, declaration merging

## 🚀 How to Use

Each topic contains:
- **Interactive examples** you can run and modify
- **Step-by-step explanations** of what's happening
- **Common gotchas** and misconceptions
- **Practical applications** of the concepts

Navigate to any folder and run the examples to see the concepts in action!

## 🎯 Target Audience

- **Intermediate developers** who want to deepen their understanding
- **Self-taught programmers** looking to fill knowledge gaps
- **Students** preparing for technical interviews
- **Anyone** curious about how programming languages really work

## 🤝 Contributing

Found a concept that tutorials commonly skip? Have a better way to explain something? Contributions are welcome! Please focus on:

- **Fundamental concepts** rather than advanced topics
- **Clear, interactive examples** with detailed explanations
- **Common misconceptions** and how to avoid them

*Because understanding the fundamentals is the difference between copying code and writing code.*
